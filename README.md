# Halite-Game-Bot
One of the projects I’m most proud of is the Halite game bot that my team and I developed. Halite is a territory-control game where each bot expands its territory, manages resources, and competes to overpower opponents on the board.

We focused heavily on resource management and coordinated attacks. Our bot evaluated the potential of each move by considering production, power, and the positioning of opponents. It also used a heuristic to decide when to expand versus when to fortify.

The results were very rewarding: we achieved first place among student submissions. Our balanced approach proved effective in navigating complex game situations and adapting to new challenges during the match.

A key factor in this success was our teamwork. We worked closely together, dividing tasks and communicating consistently about progress and obstacles. This collaboration helped us integrate all ideas into a powerful solution. We held brainstorming sessions to ensure everyone’s ideas were heard. We relied on constructive feedback, every proposal was examined and improved collectively, which led to a solid final outcome.
